public class FileListing {
//  Here's a simple bit of code to write: display a sorted list of the filenames in a folder. That should take a couple of minutes, including googling around for how to get the contents of a directory.
//
//  Except that on some systems you're getting weird filenames like "." and ".." that you don't want to display.
//
//  Except that there are also hidden files, either based on an attribute or a naming convention, and you should ignore those too.
//
//  Except that you need the sort to be case insensitive or else the results won't make sense to most users.
//
//  Except that some people are using spaces between words and some are using underscores, so they should be treated the same when sorting.
//
//  Except that a naive sort is going to put "File 10" before "File 9", and while that's logical in the cold innards of the CPU, it's no excuse to present the data that way.
//
//          And this is a well-understood, weird old relic of a problem that's nothing compared to all the special cases and exceptions needed to implement a solid user experience in a modern app. Making beautiful code ugly--and maybe impossible to prove correct--by making things easier for the user is a good thing.
